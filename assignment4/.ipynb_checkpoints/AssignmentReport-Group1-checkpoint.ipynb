    "The first improvement was to introduce cyclic learning rate, since this seems like a very effective approach to tuning the learning rate, and has shown great results in [the paper by Leslie N. Smith](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186). We've just implemented a not too sophisticated learning rate scheduler in train.py. We set the scheduler with base_lr = 2e-4, max_lr 2e-1 and mode='triangular2'.\n",
